<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Kimberlee Wong :D (<em>she/her</em>)</h1>

I am a recent graduate of the Master of [Environmental Data Science program] (https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science/academics-meds-program) at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. I am passionate about the environment, people, and open science, and I've learned how to use data tools in order to support this passion. Outside of work and school, I find the most fulfillment in creative endeavors. I consider myself an amatuer nail artist and painter; my main painting medium is gouache. 

## Things I love
